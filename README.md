Predicting the evolution of the 'Atlantic puffin' population in time and space according to different global warming scenarios.

The 'Atlantic puffin' ('macareux moine' in French) is a small seabird from North Atlantic Ocean which breeds in large colonies on costal cliffs or offshore islands, especially in Russia, Iceland, Ireland, British, Norway and the Faore Islands. Climate change and the increase of the sea surface temperature (SST) lead to difficulties to feed themselves during the breeding season. Today, puffins are declared a vulnerable species (IUCN RedList) because of the decreasing of the population. 
We have therefore attempted to predict the evolution of this species' population according to the different climate scenarios envisaged by the CMIP6 (Coupled model intercomparison project) : 
- SSP 5.8-5 (most pessimistic)
- SSP 2.4-5 (intermediate scenario)
- SSP 1.2-6 (most optimistic)
