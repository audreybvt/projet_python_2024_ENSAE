# Motivations

The 'Atlantic puffin' ('macareux moine' in French) is a small seabird from North Atlantic Ocean which breeds in large colonies on costal cliffs or offshore islands, especially in Russia, Iceland, Ireland, British, Norway and the Faore Islands. Climate change and the increase of the sea surface temperature (SST) lead to difficulties to feed themselves during the breeding season. Today, puffins are declared a vulnerable species (IUCN RedList) because of the decreasing of the population. 
We have therefore attempted to predict the evolution of this species' population according to the different climate scenarios envisaged by the CMIP6 (Coupled model intercomparison project) : 
- SSP 5.8-5 (most pessimistic)
- SSP 2.4-5 (intermediate scenario)
- SSP 1.2-6 (most optimistic)

# Data used
* [CMIP6 climate projections](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/projections-cmip6?tab=overview), database available with Copernicus, composed of historical and predictive data, for several scenarios, several models and several variables (we will focus on the 'SST' (sea surface temperature) variable only).
* [Atlantic puffin data](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15665), based on _"Centennial relationships between ocean temperature and Atlantic puffin production reveal shifting decennial trends", Erpur S. Hansen and ali, Global Change Biology, August 2021_.
* [eBird](https://ebird.org/data/download), online database providing scientists and birdwatchers with real-time information on bird abundance and distribution.
