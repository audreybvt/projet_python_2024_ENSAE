    "We share a passion for a clumsy but reaaaally cute seabird that is very common in Iceland : **the Atlantic puffin**. Unluckily, its demographic trend is downward. Well, it's not all by chance. Various high-qualited scientific studies have been carried out over the years to demonstrate the challenges facing this seabird species. Its biggest enemy to date is **climate change**, which is affecting its feeding (fish), reproduction and nesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this notebook, we set out to (re)demonstrate the causal link between global warming and the decline in the Atlantic puffin population. **The aim at the end of this page is to establish medium-term predictions for the evolution of this species, taking into account the different climate scenarios envisaged. Graphical visualization tools will support our modeling results.** \n",
